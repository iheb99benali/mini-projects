python-console-games
console run games/algorithms, shows the use of basic algorithms like backtracking, flood-fill etc...

to run the codes either copy or download and run it in the IDE of your choice.

the folder includes:

a connectFour game: an Object oriented Programming based game, built using basic algorithms/rules, such as pattern matching, Grid Traversal, recursive function calls for input correction etc... also kind of a gravity simulator for symbols to be at the bottom
a MinesSweeper game: an Object oriented Programming based game, basic minesweeper, that shows the use of floodfill algorithm, recursive function calls, input validation, error handeling, grid/matrix manipulation etc...
a sudoku solver: given a unique and solvable sudoku grid, it will solve the grid using a simple backtracking algorith
